                  <h4>Special needed care with high-risk foods</h4>
                  <br />

                  <p>1. Raw and cooked meat - such as chicken and minced meat, and foods containing them, such as casseroles, curries and lasagne.</p>

                  <p>2. Dairy products - such as custard and dairy-based desserts like custard tarts and cheesecake.</p>

                  <p>3. ready-to-eat foods - such as sandwiches, rolls, and pizzas that contain any of the food above.</p>

                  <p>4. eggs and egg products - such as mousse.</p>

                  <h3>Freezing food safely:</h3>
              
                  <p>- When shopping, buy chilled and frozen foods at the end of your trip and take them home to store as quickly as possible. </p><p>
                    - On hot days or for trips longer than 30 minutes, try to take an insulated cooler bag or ice pack to keep frozen 
                    foods cold. Keep hot and cold foods separate while you take them home.</p>
                  <br/>

                  <h4>Storing cooked food safely:</h4>
                  <br/>
                  <p>When you have cooked food and want to cool it:
                  </p>
                  <p> - Put hot food into shallow dishes or separate into smaller portions to help cool the food as quickly as possible.</p>
                  <p> - Don't put very hot food into the refrigerator. Wait until steam has stopped rising from the food before putting it in the fridge.</p>

                  <h4>Throwing out food:</h4>
                  <br/>
                  <p> Sometimes it is inevitable that you will need to throw away food, and thats fine! However make sure that you are sure food has gone bad!</p>

                  <h5>When in doubt:</h5>
                  <br/>
                  <p> Throw out high-risk food left in the temperature danger zone for more than 4 hours - don't put it in the fridge and don't keep it for later.<p>
                    </p> Check the use-by dates on food products and discard out-of-date food. If you are uncertain of the use-by date, throw it out.</p>
                  <br/>

                  <h4>First some facts you may not know:</h4>
                  <h6>1. There is enough food produced in the world to feed everyone, global hunger does not need to be a reality!</h6>
                  <br />
                  <h6>2. One third of all food produced is lost or wasted around 1.3 billion tonnes of food costing the global economy close to $940 billion each year!</h6>
                  <br />
                  <h6>3. Up to 10% of global greenhouse gases comes from food that is produced, but not eaten.</h6>
                  <br />
                  <h6>4. Wasting food is worse than total emissions from flying (1.9%), plastic production (3.8%) and oil extraction (3.8%).</h6>
                  <br />
                  <h6>5. If food waste was a country, it would be the third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after USA and China!</h6>
                  <br />
                  <h6>6. Almost half of all fruit and vegetables produced are wasted (that’s 3.7 trillion apples if you were wondering).!</h6>
                  <br />
                  <h6>However there is some hope in mitigating the effects of climate change as due to the vast amount of food wasted, combating food waste is one of the most effecive ways in reducing the effects of climate change! </h6>
